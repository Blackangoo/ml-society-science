The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to create randomised response datasets.

\begin{exercise}
  Work in teams of 3-4 students.

  First, develop an algorithm that takes binary data as input, and creates a
  randomised response output. More specifically, the inputs are
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\epsilon$, the privacy loss
  \item $D$, a matrix of $n$ columns (features) and $T$ rows (data points).
  \end{itemize}

  Your algorithm will be tested with a small dataset consisting of two features only, $x$ and $y$
  For that, you should estimate the following probabilities:
  \begin{align}
    P(x = 1), & P(y=1)\\
    P(y = 1 | x = 0), & P(y = 1 | x =1)
  \end{align}

  In the end, plot how your estimate of these probabilities changes as
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\epsilon$ increases from $0$ to $10$ in increments of $0.1$
  \item $T$ increases from 1 to 1000.
  \end{itemize}

  The basics on how to do that will be introduced in the course.
\end{exercise}
