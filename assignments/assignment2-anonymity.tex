The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to create anonymised datasets.

\begin{exercise}
  Work in teams of 3-4 students.


  First, select an arbitrary classification dataset from \url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php?task=cla}. 

  Then, develop an algorithm for $k$-anonymity. This requires you to
  anonymise the data somehow, in the sense that every record should
  have at least $k$ identical records in the database.

  While in the original $k$-anonymity definition the data in the
  original records was somehow masked, here you can simply replace the
  values with something else instead of a mask. For example, if you
  want to group together people with ages 60 to 70, you can replace
  their ages with their average age. While it is not trivial to find
  the right grouping so as to achieve $k$-anonymity, there are many
  efficient approaches you can use. 

  You can assume that the data is numerical, so you can use a numpy
  array. If you already are familiar with pandas, it is also possible
  to use pandas dataframes.

  We will start this assignment in-class. This includes ideas about
  how to do it. Please finish it at home before the next session.
