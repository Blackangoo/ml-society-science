\chapter*{Preface}

This book is a technical introduction to important aspects of machine learning in science and society. It covers the most fundamental concepts in privacy, fairness, causality, reproducibility and experiment design. While I have tried to make the book as rigorous as possible, in the interest of brevity some technical details are omitted.

I whole-heartedly recommend the book ``The Ethical Algorithm'' as a non-technical companion to this book.
