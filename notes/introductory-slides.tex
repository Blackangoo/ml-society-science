  % What are the central problems in machine learning?
  Problems in machine learning are similar to problems in science.
  Scientists must plan experiments intelligently and collect data.
  The must be able to use the data to verify a different hypothesis.
  More generally, they must be able to make decisions under
  uncertainty (Without uncertainty, there would be no need to gather more data).
  Similar problems appear in more mundane tasks, like learning to drive a car.

  For that reason, science is a very natural application area for
  machine learning.  We can model the effects of climate change and
  how to mitigate it; discover structure in social networks; map
  the existence of dark matter in the universe by intelligently
  shifting through weak gravitational lens data, and not only study
  the mechanisms of protein folding, but discover methods to
  synthesize new drugs.

  We must be careful, however. In many cases we need to be able to
  interpret what our model tells us. We also must make sure that
  the any results we obtain are reproducible.

  While machine learning models in science are typically carefully
  handcrafted by scientists and experts in machine learning and
  statistics, this is not typically the case in everyday
  applications. Nevertheless, well-known or home-grown machine
  learning models are being deployed across the application
  spectrum. This involve home assistants that try and get you want,
  web advertising, which tries to find new things for you to want,
  lending, which tries to optimally lend you money so that you buy
  what you didn't need before. We also have autonomous vehicles,
  which take you were you want to go, and ridesharing services,
  which do the same thing, but use humans instead. Finally, there
  are many applications in public policy, such as crime prevention,
  justice, and disease control which use machine learning.  In all
  those cases, we have to worry about a great many things that are
  outside the scope of the machine learning problems itself. These
  are (a) privacy: you don't want your data used in ways that you have
  not consented to (b) fairness: you don't want minorities to be
  disadvantaged and (c) safety: you don't want your car to crash.

    As an example, in the 1990s a the governor of Massachussets,
    decided to publish anonymised information about the health records
    of individual state employs. They were careful to hide all
    obviously identifying information such as their name, and thus
    claimed that there are no potential privacy violations. However,
    they left in some information that they thought would be useful
    for researchers: the postcode, the birthdate, and the sex of each
    individual.
    
    This allowed a PhD student, McSweeney, to perform the following
    linkage attack. She order a floppy disk containing database of
    voting records in the state. This contained names and addresses,
    as well as the postcode, birth date and sex of every voter. In that
    way, she was able to cross-reference this data, and so obtain the
    identities of individuals in that database. The first record she
    obtained was that of the governor himself, Bill Weld. Later, she
    estimated that approximately 87\% of Americans are uniquely
    identifiable through those three attributes.
