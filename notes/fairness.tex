\chapter{Fairness.}
\label{ch:fairness}
\only<article>{ When machine learning algorithms are applied at scale,
  it can be difficult to imagine what their effects might be. In this
  part of the book, we consider notions of fairness as seen through
  the prism of conditional independence and meritocracy. The first
  notion requires that we look deeper into directed graphical models.
  
  The problem of fairness in machine learning and
  artificial intelligence has only recently been widely
  recognised. When any algorithm is implemented at scale, no matter
  the original objective and whether it is satisfied, it has
  significant societal effects. In particular, even when considering
  the narrow objective of the algorithm, even if it improves it
  overall, it may increase inequality.
  
  In this course we will look at two aspects of fairness. The first
  has to do with disadvantaged populations that form distinct social
  classes due to a shared income stratum, race or gender. The second
  has to do with meritocratic notions of fairness.

\section{Some examples.}


\only<article>{ Fairness is a concept that has received much attenion
  recently when applied to large-scale algorithmic decision
  making. However, the very concept of fairness is not well-defined
  and encompasses many different ideas. Some of those relate to fair
  treatment of individuals: \emph{Meritocracy} is the idea that people
  should receive rewards according to their merit. \emph{Equal
    treatment} is the related notion that similar people should be
  treated similarly under similar circumstances. Some concepts are
  related more to the treatment of different groups:
  \emph{Proportional representation} is the idea that proportions of
  different groups in society should be reflected in every facet of
  society. Finally \emph{non-discrimination} captures the notion of
  not treating people differently depending on sensitive
  characteristics.  }

  \frametitle{Meritocracy}
  \only<article>{

    Meritocracy embodies the principle that merit should be
    rewarded. A common example are admissions to univerisities. Some
    type of summary, typically a grade obtained from high school, is
    used to represent the underlying merit of individuals.

    \begin{example}[College admissions]
      \only<article>{ In this example, we have two students. In terms
        of grades, student $B$ is clearly better. If we can only
        accept one of them, and given no other information, it seems
        like the natural choice is student $B$.  }
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Student $A$ has a grade 4/5 from Gota Highschool.
      \item Student $B$ has a grade 5/5 from Vasa Highschool.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{example}
  }
  \only<article>{Grades, by themselves, are typically insufficient information. It might be that grades from some highschools are inflated and do not represent the quality of individuals accurately. So, let us suppose we now consider the information.}
  \uncover<3->{
    \begin{example}[Additional information]
      \only<article>{
        In particular, let us suppose that we have statistics on how well students from different high school do, depending on their high school grade.
      }
      \begin{itemize}
      \item 70\% of admitted Gota graduates with 4+ get their degree.
      \item 50\% of admitted Vasa graduates with 5 get their degree.
      \end{itemize}
      \only<article>{
        All other thing being equal, it is now more likely that student $A$ will graduate. So perhaps we should take in $A$ and not $B$.
      }
    \end{example}
  }

  \uncover<4->{We still don't know how a \alert{specific} student will
    do!}

  \only<article>{ I must emphasize that these are only
    statistics, and not necessarily predictive of the students'
    ability.  Ideally, we would like to admit the students that we
    expect to do well, given the information that we have. However,
    this information is typically not enough for us to make reliable
    predictions.  In addition, we might want to also make sure that
    everybody has a chance to obtain a good education. In order to
    achieve this, we might want to promote ethnic or gender equality
    through university admissions.  Unfortunately, there is no ideal
    solution and we must always balance the benefit of individual
    students with that of specific societal groups as well as society
    as a whole.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item<5-> Admit \alert{everybody}? \only<article>{This suggests that everybody is admitted to at least one university, perhaps even their university of choice. However, it requires that there is enough teaching capacity for all students in the first year. Subsequently, we expect the students who were not qualified to drop out. Of course, this is unfair to the qualified students, as it drains resources that could have been used for them.}

    \item<7-> Use \alert{prediction} of individual academic performance? \only<article>{The more information we have, the better we can predict academic performance. A grade from high school is one indicator, but more data can be used to obtain better predictions. Of course, no prediction is perfect.}
    \item<8-> Should we take into account \alert{group membership} or other population information? \only<article>{For many reasons, students in some groups can perform differently in standardised tests, even though their innate talents may be no different than students not in the group.

  \begin{example}[Hiring decisions.]
    As a further example, consider gender balance in hiring decisions.
    Typically, received applications are screened, so that some
    applicants undergo through an interview process. At the end, some
    of the interviewed applicants will be hired. There are two
    decision points here, with most people being cut off at the first
    point: the screening. To automate this process, Amazon worked on
    resume-screen program.~\footnote{\url{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G}}
    However, this was scrapped after it was discovered that it
    predominantly favoured men. The reason is not entirely clear, but
    it was probably due to the fact that they trained the system on
    their own screening decisions, and given that the tech industry
    predominantly hires men in the first place, women were likely
    rejected in the screening phase.

  \frametitle{Bail decisions}

  \only<article>{ For a more detailed
    example, let us consider bail decisions in the US court
    system. When a defendant is charged, the judge has the option to
    either place them in jail pending trial, or set them free, under
    the condition that the defendant pays some amount of 'bail'. The
    amount of bail (if any) is set to deter flight or a relapse.

    This process sometimes includes the use of a software tool called
    \texttt{COMPAS}, which gives risk scores for the possibility of
    flight, recidivism or violent behaviour. These scores are taken
    into account by judges when making decisions.  In some cases, it
    appears as though automating this procedure might lead to better
    outcomes. But is that generally true?
