* MLE estimation for randomised response

We have data $x \in \{0,1\}^T$, output $a$.
The marginal likelihood is

\begin{align}
	\Pr^\pi_\theta(a)
	& = \sum_x P_\theta(x) \pi(a | x)
\end{align}

Let $m = \|a\|_1$ and wlog say that the first m $a_t$ are 1 and the
rest zero.  We can now consider two independent Binomial distributions
for each interval, with outcomes k and n respectively. The number of
disagreements will be $m-k$ in the first interval, i.e. equal to the
number of zeros.  For the second interval, it will be n, the number of
ones. So we can rewrite the probability as:
\begin{align}
	\Pr^\pi_\theta(a)
	& = \sum_{k,n}
	P_\theta(\|x_1^m\|_1 = k)
	P_\theta(\|x_{m+1}^T\|_1 = n)
	\pi(\|a_1^m - x_1^m\|_1 = m - k)
	\pi(\|a_{m+1}^T - x_{m+1}^T\|_1 =  n)
	\\
	& = \sum_{k,n}
	B(k | m, \theta)
	B(n | T - m, \theta)
	B(m - k | m, p)
	B(n | T - m, p).
\end{align}
